# single-cell-bioinformatics

Course material in notebook format for learning about single cell bioinformatics methods. To view this material, you have two options:

1. View the [live version](http://mybinder.org/repo/YeoLab/single-cell-bioinformatics) where you can run and edit code (also accessible by clicking the pink "launch binder" badge above)
2. View the [static version](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/yeolab/single-cell-bioinformatics/blob/master/index.ipynb) where you cannot run or edit code, but view all the content
3. Set this up on your own computer
    * 1. Install [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) with Python 3. Command line instructions for mac and linux are shown below.
```
# Mac OS X
curl https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh > miniconda.sh

# 64-bit Linux
curl https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh > miniconda.sh

# After downloading, install (both Mac and Linux)
bash -b miniconda.sh
```
    * 2. Clone this repository and all submodules

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/YeoLab/single-cell-bioinformatics
```
    * 3. Go to the new directory
```
cd single-cell-bioinformatics
```
    * 4. Create a new environment with the necessary packages
```
conda create --yes -n single-cell-bioinformatcs --file conda_requirements.txt
```
    * 5. Activate the environment
```
source activate single-cell-bioinformatcs  # On windows, do "activate single-cell-bioinformatcs"
```
    * 6. Install the remaiing requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
    * 7. PHEW. Now you can launch the notebooks!!
```
jupyter notebook
```
