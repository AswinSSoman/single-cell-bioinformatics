    "## Supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've talked only about *unsupervised* learning methods. Using hierarchical clustering or PCA/ICA/MDS/t-SNE, we didn't give the algorithm any knowledge about the groups we originally had. This is called \"unsupervised\" because the computer is playing around with the data on its own and you haven't told the program anything about *what* to look for, just to look.\n",

    "## Unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning is where you tell the machine learning algorithm the question you're looking for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What genes tell group X and Y samples apart?\n",
    "* What genes change along differentiation?\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the algorithm goes and finds them. In this course we'll talk about two different kinds of supervised learning that are related to single-cell analysis.\n",
